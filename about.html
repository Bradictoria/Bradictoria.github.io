        <h2>History</h2>
        <p><strong>Bradictoria</strong> was founded in 546AD during <strong>"The Dark Times"</strong> these times existed when there was no democracy and only the communist <strong>Ominicron</strong> domanated the beuatiful future lands of democracy. Our first <strong>Emperor</strong>, <strong>Markius</strong> <strong>Julingham</strong> he had enough of the communist regime and created our way of life <strong>Democracy</strong>. He worked in secrect to avoid attention and was able to recriut 10 thousand people within the first month <strong>Markius</strong> had picked up attention from the <strong>Ominicron</strong>. <strong>Markius</strong> had a choice to make. Defend <strong>Democracy</strong> or succumb to the <strong>Ominicron</strong>. He thought about it for days and eventualy told his followers to arm themselves and the famous first motto for <strong>Bradictoria</strong> was created <strong>Fight for Freedom</strong>. This inspired many people to join the fight and then begain the peirod konw as <strong>The Libaration Peirod</strong>. This peirod was when small outbreaks of <strong>Bradictorian Armed Forces</strong> attacked in small groups to alert the <strong>Ominicron</strong> amd divert their forces from the main target. This worked so well that in just 3 short months the <strong>Ominicron</strong> could not handle the power of <strong>Bradictoria</strong> and they collapsed and with their downfall <strong>Communism</strong> was replaced with <strong>Democracy</strong> took its place as did <strong>Bradictoria</strong> with the <strong>Ominicron</strong>.
